      <h1>Why CryptoZombies is Different
        Students
        1M+
        Classes Completed</h1>
    </div>
    <p>CryptoZombies is the largest education platform for blockchain development, its been around for 4+ years, with over 400k registered users that have finished multiple courses.
      CryptoZombies was the first tutorial on the internet for NFTs, and is still very relevant to the new crop of web3 developers looking to enter the industry today. Currently the CryptoZombies curriculum is mostly focused on Ethereum and Solidity development, but is a lot of demand for content targeting other chains such as Binance, TRON, and even projects like Chainlink.</p>

<h1>Interactive Coding Lessons</h1>
<p>In-browser step-by-step lessons take you from the very basics of Solidity to creating your own fully-functional blockchain-based game. Even by the end of Lesson 1 (which can be completed in one sitting), you'll know enough to officially call yourself a blockchain developer!</p>
